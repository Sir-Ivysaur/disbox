# disbox â€” distrobox without the **tro**uble

I don't remember anything about [distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox). If only there was a GUI for it! Well there isn't (there is [one](https://github.com/fearlessgeekmedia/DistroGUI) but it's in alpha and is already being completely rewritten) one, so I'm making a TUI script. Fun. For all of you who don't (or don't want to) understand how to use Distrobox.

**As of writing this, only creating containers works.**

**You will need some things**. You'll need [`gum`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum), which is used to build all them fancy buttons. And `cowsay` (it's on pretty much every package repo). Because it's funny. I recommend installing these with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), it's just the easiest way, honestly. Moo.
